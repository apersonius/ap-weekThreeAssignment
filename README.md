## Description

I created a password generator from starter code. This password generator gives you the option to choose the length (between 8 and 128) of password as well as if it will contain upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, symbols, or all of the above. The user will answer prompts for the aforementioned customizations and then the password will be generated and displayed on the screen.

Click on the generate password button on the page and answer the prompts for length of password, and inclusion of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, or symbols. The password will be generated and appear on the screen. Copy the generated password.
